### DEVELOPING CUSTOM PYTORCH DATALOADERS ⚛️

A significant amount of the effort applied to developing machine learning algorithms is related to data preparation. PyTorch provides many tools to make data loading easy and hopefully, makes your code more readable. In this recipe, you will learn how to:

#### Create a custom dataset leveraging the PyTorch dataset APIs
* Creating vocabulary, setting up the dataset to process 1 example at a time

#### Put these components together to create a custom dataloader
* Processing data in patches
* Adding padding to variable length sequence

#### Understand the Dataset and Dataloader class in detail
