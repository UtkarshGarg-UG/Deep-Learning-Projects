This repo contains projects related to Vision, NLP and Reinforcement Learning




# [Building from Scratch](https://github.com/UtkarshGarg-UG/Deep-Learning-Projects/tree/main/Building%20from%20Scratch) :snowflake:

### 1. [Sentiment analysis in numpy](https://github.com/UtkarshGarg-UG/Deep-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Building%20from%20Scratch/Sentiment_analysis_in_numpy.ipynb) :blush: :confused:
Building a neural network from scratch. We understand the effect of importance of learning rate and input size on training speed. 
Also we check out the learnt embeddings of similar words

### 2. [Sequence to Sequence model for Machine Translation](https://github.com/UtkarshGarg-UG/Deep-Learning-Projects/tree/main/Building%20from%20Scratch/seq_to_seq) :flags:
An Encoder Decoder based model to translate from English to Hindi. The code is customizable to be used for other translation tasks.

# [NLP](https://github.com/UtkarshGarg-UG/Deep-Learning-Projects/tree/main/NLP) :star2:

### 1. [Loading a custom dataset](https://github.com/UtkarshGarg-UG/Deep-Learning-Projects/blob/main/NLP/loading%20custom%20dataset.ipynb) :notes:
Loading a custom dataset. Can be used for both text and images.

# [Computer Vision](https://github.com/UtkarshGarg-UG/Deep-Learning-Projects/tree/main/Computer-Vision) :eyes:

### 1. Landmark (classification)(https://github.com/UtkarshGarg-UG/Deep-Learning-Projects/tree/main/Computer-Vision/Landmark) :tokyo_tower:
Classify images into 50 Landmarks. Albumentations for augmentation. And a pretrained Resnet-34 for transfer learning

# [Reusable Codes](https://github.com/UtkarshGarg-UG/Deep-Learning-Projects/tree/main/Reusable-Codes) :cyclone:

### 1. [Hooks](https://github.com/UtkarshGarg-UG/Deep-Learning-Projects/tree/main/Reusable-Codes/Hooks) :dart: 
1.1 [Forward Hooks](https://github.com/UtkarshGarg-UG/Deep-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Reusable-Codes/Hooks/forward_hook.ipynb)
Learn about hooks in pytorch ([Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syLFCVYua6Q))

Forward hooks can be used for model debugging and create activation maps

### 2. [Resume Training from Checkpoint](https://github.com/UtkarshGarg-UG/Deep-Learning-Projects/tree/main/Reusable-Codes/Resuming%20Training) :arrow_forward:
This code saves training information into checkpoints and use it to resume training
