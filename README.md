# Deep-Learning-Projects
This repo contains projects related to Vision, NLP and Reinforcement Learning




## Building from Scratch :snowflake:

#### 1. [Sentiment analysis in numpy](https://github.com/UtkarshGarg-UG/Deep-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Building%20from%20Scratch/Sentiment_analysis_in_numpy.ipynb) :blush: :confused:
Building a neural network from scratch. We understand the effect of importance of learning rate and input size on training speed. 
Also we check out the learnt embeddings of similar words


#### 2. [Effect of different weight initializations](https://github.com/UtkarshGarg-UG/Deep-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Building%20from%20Scratch/weight_initialization/Effect%20of%20init%20of%20weights.ipynb) :crystal_ball: 
Here we discuss different methods of weight initializations and also dicuss why things work the way they do.

## Natural language Processing :star2:

#### 1. [Loading a custom Text dataset](https://github.com/UtkarshGarg-UG/Deep-Learning-Projects/blob/main/NLP/Custom%20Dataset/loading%20custom%20dataset%20(text).ipynb) :notes:
Loading a custom dataset in pytorch for machine translation. Can be used for both text and images.

#### 2. [Sequence to Sequence model for Machine Translation](https://github.com/UtkarshGarg-UG/Deep-Learning-Projects/tree/main/NLP/Seq2Seq) :flags:
An Encoder Decoder based model to translate from English to Hindi. The code is customizable to be used for other translation tasks.

## Computer Vision :eyes:

#### 1. [Landmark Classification](https://github.com/UtkarshGarg-UG/Deep-Learning-Projects/tree/main/Computer-Vision/Landmark) :tokyo_tower:
Classify images into 50 Landmarks. Albumentations for augmentation. And a pretrained Resnet-34 for transfer learning

#### 2. [Loading a custom image dataset](https://github.com/UtkarshGarg-UG/Deep-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Computer-Vision/Loading-Custom-Dataset/loading_custom_dataset_images.ipynb) :cupcake:
Loading a custom dataset in pytorch for image classification

## Reusable Codes :cyclone:

#### 1. [Hooks](https://github.com/UtkarshGarg-UG/Deep-Learning-Projects/tree/main/Reusable-Codes/Hooks) :dart: 
1.1 [Forward Hooks](https://github.com/UtkarshGarg-UG/Deep-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Reusable-Codes/Hooks/forward_hook.ipynb)
Learn about hooks in pytorch ([Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syLFCVYua6Q))

Forward hooks can be used for model debugging and create activation maps

#### 2. [Resume Training from Checkpoint](https://github.com/UtkarshGarg-UG/Deep-Learning-Projects/tree/main/Reusable-Codes/Resuming%20Training) :arrow_forward:
This code saves training information into checkpoints and use it to resume training
