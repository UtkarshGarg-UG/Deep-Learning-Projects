## [Reusable Codes](https://github.com/UtkarshGarg-UG/Deep-Learning-Projects/tree/main/Reusable-Codes)

### 1. [Hooks](https://github.com/UtkarshGarg-UG/Deep-Learning-Projects/tree/main/Reusable-Codes/Hooks) 
1.1 [Forward Hooks](https://github.com/UtkarshGarg-UG/Deep-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Reusable-Codes/Hooks/forward_hook.ipynb)
Learn about hooks in pytorch ([Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syLFCVYua6Q))

Forward hooks can be used for model debugging and create activation maps

### 2. [Resume Training from Checkpoint](https://github.com/UtkarshGarg-UG/Deep-Learning-Projects/tree/main/Reusable-Codes/Resuming%20Training)
This code saves training information into checkpoints and use it to resume training


## [Building from Scratch](https://github.com/UtkarshGarg-UG/Deep-Learning-Projects/tree/main/Building%20from%20Scratch)

### 1. [Sentiment analysis in numpy](https://github.com/UtkarshGarg-UG/Deep-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Building%20from%20Scratch/Sentiment_analysis_in_numpy.ipynb)
Building a neural network from scratch. We understand the effect of importance of learning rate and input size on training speed. 
Also we check out the learnt embeddings of similar words
